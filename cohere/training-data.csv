What is the Oracle Autonomous Database?,"Oracle Autonomous Database is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running - without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-managing, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors.The Oracle Autonomous Database is fully elastic: You simply specify the number of OCPUs and the storage capacity in TB's for the database. At any time, you may scale up or down the OCPUs or the storage capacity.Autonomous Database supports four main types of workload:Click here for more information.<https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-add-resources.html#GUID-DA72422A-5A70-42FA-A363-AB269600D4B0>"
What is the difference between Dedicated vs. Severless deployments?,"Serverless: With this option, you provision and manage only the Autonomous Database, while Oracle deploys and manages all the underlying infrastructure. Oracle autonomously operates all aspects of the database life cycle from database placement to backup and updates.Dedicated: this offers a private cloud in the public cloud. A completely dedicated compute, storage, network and database service for only a single tenant. This offers a multitenant database architecture, allowing you to create and manage multiple Autonomous Databases within a single database system. Autonomous Database Dedicated is also available in customer's data centers with Exadata Cloud at Customer."

What is Autonomous Database Dedicated ?,"Autonomous Database Dedicated (ADB-D) is a deployment choice that enables customers to provision autonomous databases into their own dedicated Exadata cloud infrastructure.ADB-D provides the customer customization over operational polices, including software and hardware isolation for the highest levels of performance and security governance; it is well suited for customers wanting to deploy Oracle Autonomous Database in cloud with common enterprise lifecycle controls and especially ideal for customers who want a self-service capability via their own database cloud. ADB-D is available in the Oracle Cloud and in the customer’s data center with Exadata Cloud@Customer."
What is the difference between Autonomous Database Dedicated and Autonomous Database Serverless?,"Autonomous Database cloud services offer two infrastructure choices, serverless and dedicated:With serverless (ADB-S), the simplest configuration, multiple customers share the resources of an Exadata cloud infrastructure. These customers can quickly get started with no minimum commitment, enjoying quick database provisioning and independent scalability of compute and storage. Serverless runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.With dedicated (ADB-D), the customer must first subscribe to a dedicated Exadata cloud infrastructure that is isolated from other tenants, with no shared processor, memory, network, or storage resources. This infrastructure choice offers greater control of the software and infrastructure lifecycle, customizable policies for separation of database workload, software update schedules and versioning, workload consolidation, and availability policies. Dedicated infrastructure is available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Exadata Cloud@Customer.Both Autonomous Database infrastructure options ensure high availability, exceptional performance, and multi-level security."
When should I use ADB Dedicated (ADB-D) versus ADB Serverless (ADB-S)?,"ADB-S delegates all operational decisions to Oracle for the highest level of autonomous experience - think of a fully autonomous vehicle with no need for a steering wheel or cruise control. ADB Serverless (ADB-S) enables customers to quickly provision their own autonomous databases and become productive.ADB Dedicated (ADB-D), on the other hand, is more like an autonomous vehicle that still includes a steering wheel and cruise control. ADB-D offers greater control and isolation starting at the Exadata cloud infrastructure level, with customizable maintenance schedules, software update versions, backup retention periods, etc. ADB-D allows customers to group and separates out databases based on organizational structure and criticality of application workload. ADB-D is ideal for customers looking to deliver a self-service database capability within their own database cloud environment running either on the public cloud or in the customer’s data center. Using this model, customer fleet administrators can use the steering wheel and cruise control (customized operational policies) to tailor an operational plan for different parts of their organization, then the organization consumes via a self-service experience similar to the vehicle with no need for a steering wheel or cruise control."
What types of database workload are best to run on ADB Dedicated?,"You can run all your data warehousing (ADW-D), transaction processing or mixed workload (ATP-D) databases of any size, scale or criticality on ADB dedicated. As well as supporting databases that may require highest governance, consistent performance and operational controls.With Exadata Cloud@Customer deployment, ADB Dedicated is ideal for on-prem customers desiring Autonomous Database but cannot move to the public cloud due to data sovereignty, corporate policies, network latency and security requirements etc."
Can I run both Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse databases on ADB Dedicated?,"Yes, you can have a mix of ATP-D and ADW-D databases on the same ADB dedicated Exadata rack."
What is Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer?,"Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer (or ADB-ExaC@C for short) is Autonomous Database Dedicated running on Gen 2 Exadata Cloud@ Customer for on-premises deployment. It is the same ADB Dedicated cloud service as on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure except it runs in the customer’s data centers. This is for customers desiring Autonomous Database but cannot leverage the public cloud due to sovereignty laws, industry regulations, corporate policies, network latency and security requirements, or customers that have on-premises applications that are tightly coupled with databases running locally."
What are the key differences between Autonomous Database Dedicated on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer?,"It is the same Autonomous Database dedicated cloud service running on 2 different platforms. Both services are managed via the same interface, OCI Console, CLI and REST APIs. They have the same feature set; however new features on these platforms will have different release dates.The key differences are:"
Who is responsible for the backup and restore for Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer?,"Oracle Autonomous Database is responsible for backup and restore operations, and the management of object storage and local Exadata storage. Backup and restore using customer managed storage (NFS and ZDLRA) are the customer’s responsibility."
Who is responsible for the patching the Autonomous databases on Exadata Cloud@Customer?,Oracle Autonomous Database is responsible for patching both the Exadata and user databases (Dom0 and DomU); customers has the option to override the default patching schedule with their preferred schedule.
Can I deploy a mix of Exadata Database and Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer?,"In the first release, customer must designate whether an ExaC@C rack is for Autonomous Database or Exadata Database. Supporting a mix of Autonomous Database and Exadata Database is a roadmap item for CY 2021."

"If I have an Exadata X8 Quarter Rack, how many total OCPUs are available for ADB-D databases?","Exadata Infrastructure on an X8 Quarter Rack has 100 enabled CPU cores; therefore, it can support as many databases as it has CPU cores, i.e. 100 databases.When ADB-D supports fractional OCPUs/overprovisioning, you will be able to have up to 10 databases running on a single CPU core, however you can only have a maximum of 200 databases within each Autonomous Container Database provisioned for High Availability deployment."
How many Autonomous Container Databases and Autonomous Databases are supported on ADB Dedicated?,"You can have up to 12 autonomous container databases with a maximum of 200 autonomous databases on Half and Full rack, and 100 autonomous databases for Quarter rack per container database for the high availability configuration.See here<https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/atp-cloud/atpfg/characteristics-aeis1.html> for more info."
What is the role of a Fleet Administrator in ADB Dedicated?,"Fleet administrator is a logical service role (managed by IAM privileges) responsible for the creation and the management of Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure (AEI) and Autonomous Container Database (ACD) resources for dedicated deployments. On Exadata Cloud@Customer, the fleet administrator is also responsible for provisioning and managing Backup Destinations and Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster. These resources must be created before dedicated Autonomous databases can be created.The logical role is materialized by granting IAM privileges to a group of users (a Fleet Administrator Group) to manage the AEI and ACD resources. Please see Fleet Administrator’s Guide to Autonomous Database Dedicated Deployments<https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/atp-cloud&id=GUID-B5518C12-0362-4A98-AB35-3CB84AC83F31> for more information."
What is the role of a Database Administrator in ADB Dedicated?,"Database Administrator is both a logical service user role (managed by IAM privileges) and a Database User role responsible for the creation, monitoring and management of Autonomous databases. In order to manage the Autonomous Database resource, the service role must also be able to at a minimum USE Autonomous Container Database resources, which must be visible to assign as the target for the ADB during provisioning.Database Users are in essence application developers, users who can connect to and use an Autonomous Database to store and access the data generated by applications. Database Users are not managed by IAM like service users, rather they are managed by capabilities built natively into the Autonomous Database. A Database Administrator is an IAM service user who is also a special case Database User, a user with the highest level of ADB privileges.The Database Administrator can create, connect and manages schema and user access to autonomous databases. The Database Administrator has the exact same responsibilities in ADB-D as in ADB-S."
Can I use Enterprise Manager to monitor ADB Dedicated instances?,"Yes, you can use on-prem EM 13.3+ or the OCI Marketplace EM 13c Image to monitor both ADB Dedicated on OCI and Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@CustomerFor more information, refer to the EM Cloud Control Administrator’s Guide for Oracle Autonomous Databases<https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.4/emadb/use-oracle-enterprise-manager-autonomous-databases.html>."
